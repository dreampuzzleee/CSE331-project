1. Why did Fibonacci fail the testThrowsIllegalArgumentException< test? What (if anything) did
you have to do to fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

Because n is the index of the desired term, and it starts at 0. So if if statement is less than or
equal to 0, the test will always throw exception. Also, the comment says that throws when it's not
nonnegative number, that 0 doesn't include in it, since 0 is nonnegative.
So I delete "equal" from the if statement, change to (n < 0) and it works.

2. Why did Fibonacci fail the testBaseCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to fix
it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The test fail is because the if statement also includes 2.
Based on the code in FibonacciTest, I find that the testBaseCase only include n=0,and n=1.
The expected result for both is 1. So I just need to change the if statement from (n <= 2)
to (n <= 1).

3.Why did Fibonacci fail the testInductiveCase test? What (if anything) did you have to do to
fix it? If you did not have to change anything to fix this issue, explain why.

The test fail is because the wrong sign. The nth term of Fibonacci sequence is the sum of
previous two terms which is xn= xn-1+xn-2. So I change the sign between getFibTerm(n - 1)
and getFibTerm(n - 2) from "-" to "+".
