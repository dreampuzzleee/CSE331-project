# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path found by BFS is different.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 1.000 from A to C in simpleGraph

path from B to C:
total cost: 0.000
