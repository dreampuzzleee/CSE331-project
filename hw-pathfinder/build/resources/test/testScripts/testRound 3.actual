# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# the path found by BFS is different.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph
added node D to simpleGraph

added edge 5.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from B to C in simpleGraph
added edge 3.000 from A to D in simpleGraph
added edge 5.000 from D to C in simpleGraph

path from A to C:
A to D with weight 3.000
D to C with weight 5.000
total cost: 8.000
