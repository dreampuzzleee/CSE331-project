# Tests graph creation/viewing with a simple graph ('A') with two nodes and multiple edges.

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A

# Add an edge
added edge e12a from n1 to n2 in A
added edge e21a from n2 to n1 in A
added edge e11 from n1 to n1 in A
added edge e22 from n2 to n2 in A

# Print all nodes in the graph
A contains: n1 n2

# Print all child nodes of n1, n2 with outgoing edge
the children of n1 in A are: n1(e11) n2(e12a)
the children of n2 in A are: n1(e21a) n2(e22)
