# Tests graph creation/viewing with two graphs ('A' and 'B') with one node and one edge.

# Create a graph
created graph A
created graph B

# Add a node
added node n1 to A

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in A

# Print all nodes in the graph
A contains: n1
B contains:

# Print all child nodes of n1 with outgoing edge
the children of n1 in A are: n1(e1)
