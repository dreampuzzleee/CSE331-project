# Tests graph creation/viewing with two graph ('A' and 'B') with two nodes.

# Create a graph
CreateGraph A
CreateGraph B

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode A n1
AddNode A n2

# Print all nodes in the graph
ListNodes A
ListNodes B

# Print all child nodes of n1, n2 with outgoing edge
ListChildren A n1
ListChildren A n2
