# Tests graph creation/viewing with two graph ('A' and 'B') with two nodes.

# Create a graph
created graph A
created graph B

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A

# Print all nodes in the graph
A contains: n1 n2
B contains:

# Print all child nodes of n1, n2 with outgoing edge
the children of n1 in A are:
the children of n2 in A are:
