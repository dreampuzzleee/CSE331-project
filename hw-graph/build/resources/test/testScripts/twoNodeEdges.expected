# Tests graph creation/viewing with a simple graph ('A') with two nodes and two edges.

# Create a graph
created graph A

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge e2 from n1 to n1 in A

# Print all nodes in the graph
A contains: n1 n2

# Print all child nodes of n1, n2 with outgoing edge
the children of n1 in A are: n1(e2) n2(e1)
the children of n2 in A are:
